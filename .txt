🔐 Updated Auth Rules
🔓 Public Access
✅ View stories

✅ Read comments

❌ Cannot comment or like without logging in

🔐 Logged-in Users
✅ Can comment

✅ Can like stories (maybe one like per story)

👑 Admin (you)
✅ Can upload new stories

✅ Can delete or edit any story or comment

🧠 Firebase Auth Setup Plan
We'll use Firebase Authentication to handle user logins.

Auth Providers to Support
✅ Google (Quick login)

✅ Email/Password (Optional)

❌ No account creation for upload — admin login is hardcoded

🛠 Auth Flow
Visitor clicks "Login to comment"

Redirected to login page

After login:

Their name and UID are saved

They can comment or like

Admin is detected by UID and can upload stories

👮 Firebase Firestore Security Rules (Simplified)
js
Copy
Edit
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    // Stories are public to read
    match /stories/{storyId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create, update, delete: if request.auth.uid == "YOUR_ADMIN_UID";
    }

    // Comments are readable, but only logged-in users can write
    match /comments/{commentId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
    }

    // Likes: only authenticated users can like
    match /likes/{likeId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
I’ll help you generate these rules when you're ready.

🔐 Next Step Options
Do you want me to generate a full React + Firebase boilerplate with:

Auth (Login with Google)

Public story view

Comment/Like (requires login)

Admin-only upload panel?
